            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>OWL-based ontology project that generates UI components via a SPARQL end-point. This knowledge model will be used to cleverly suggest and generate – via a SPARQL end-point – 
                the proper controls for various Web interfaces by using a set of controlled language constructs such as "Build a section with I images|videos and P paragraphs placed below|above|left|right" or 
                "Build main section having a user profile with minimum 2 paragraph, 1 image and a submit button labeled "Edit" vertically|horizontally arranged". 
                Several keywords/parameters could be inserted to express the interface designer's intention – e.g., a section could have a specific role (content, navigation, download, footer, photo gallery, calendar, slider, and so on);

                            <p>The application's frontend facilitates interactive web component generation through user inputs. It includes features like a chat interface for inputting commands to generate UI components, a toggleable text box for direct input and backend communication, real-time visual feedback of the generated UI components, and an editable HTML-like representation of the components for manual modification and refinement.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Integration with Backend</h4>
                            <p>The frontend interacts with the backend through HTTP requests, sending user inputs and receiving JSON representations of web components. The backend is responsible for parsing these inputs using NLP techniques, constructing a component graph, and generating the corresponding JSON objects. The frontend then uses this JSON to render the components on the screen.</p>
                        </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p><b>Component Generation:</b> Upon submission, the input is sent to the backend, which returns a JSON object representing the desired UI components.</p>

                            <p>Here is an example illustrating how a user's input can be transformed into a UI component:</p>
                                <li><b>Input:</b> "header black with 2 paragraph blue , accordion with 2 image , accordion with banner , photoGallery ,footer."</li>
                                <li><b>Backend Processing:</b> The input is parsed and converted into a JSON object representing the header component with 2 paragraph child and specified styles one accordion wiht 2 image child , one accordion with banner child, a photoGallery and a banner .</li>
                                <li><b>Result:</b>
                                    <img src="images/generated_page.png" alt="generate" style="  display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%;">
                        </li>
                        
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Backend</h3>
                        Technologies used : Java and Spring Boot.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Main modules</h4>
                                <p><b>Language processor: </b>performs semantic parsing and validation to convert user input into a structured and machine-readable representation.</p>
                                <p>
                                        <p>
                                            Initially, we wanted to have a format that the user needs to respect in order for the apppcation to work, and parse it using regex. For example, we thinked of a pattern pke : <i>{component} {size} {color} </i>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Turned out that this was very hard to work on more complex components, with multiple children, and also taking in consideration that the children can also have components, attributes and so on.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            After this idea, we oriented to a NLP processing, where we did not depend any more on a specific format, but on a “vali” input, on which we can scale the application a lot better.
                                            For now, we are just using NLP, but the algorithm can be improved very much by using both nlp and regex parsing.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In order to create and handle the web components, we constructed a graph similar to the HTML DOM. For each component , we represent it a node with the next values:
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>component, that represents the html component that will be created (ex. header, footer, title, image etc.);</li>
                                                <li>count, that represents how many times this component will repeat;</li>
                                                <li>A list of styles, that are the css styles that will be appped to the component;</li>
                                                <li>A list of other nodes, that are the children of the current node.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The current processing is a simple one, and follows the next rules:
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>
                                                    When “NOUN” is detected, it means that we have the type of the component (header, title, image);
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    When “NUM” is detected, the way we handle it is to set how many instances of that component to be created. For example, header with 3 title;
                                                </li>

                                                    When “CCONJ” (“and”) is detected, it means that the user wants to create a component that it “brother” with the current component, so we start creating a new component. For example, header with title and image;
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    When “ADP” (“with”) is detected, it means that the user wants to create a direct child to the current component. For example, header with image;
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    When “PUNCT” is detected, we have two situations : 
                                                    <ol>
                                                        <li>
                                                            either the user created a component, and he wants to create another, so he will type “,”. For example, header, section, footer. This input will be translated into  3 different components.
                                                        </li>
                                                        <li>
                                                            the end of the query has been processed, and in order to process the last node of the graph, the last character in the input will be DOT.
                                                        </li>
                                                    </ol>
                                                </li>
                                            </ol>
                                        </p>

                                            To achieve this NLP processing, we used the library from <i>org.apache.opennlp</i>. Two components from this library
                                            were used, <i>POSTagger</i> and
                                            <i>Tokenizer</i>. Also two more files for English language were downloaded and loaded into the application.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Example of how the graph is computed, for the next input : <i>red header with 2 image, banner, 2 blue accordion with image, right section with 8 paragraph, centered footer with banner .</i>

                                            <div>
                                                <pre>
└── 1 section[]
    ├── 1 header[red]
    │   └── 2 image[]
    ├── 1 banner[]
    ├── 2 accordion[blue]
    │   └── 1 image[]
    ├── 1 section[]
    │   └── 8 paragraph[]
    └── 1 footer[centered]
        └── 1 banner[]

                                            </div>

                                        We can see how the attributes were applied to correctly for every component. This output was directly taken from the application, where a function was implemented that 
                                        traverse the graph using dfs algorithm and print it. Currently solution is limited by the processing model, maximum depth in the graph that can be reached being 3.

                                    After the graph is constructed, using the DFS algorithm, we traverse the graph, and for each component, it queries
                                    the ontology for the default values.

                                    loads a local ontology.</p>

                                    The ontology was created for mapping existing component properties. At the top level, under owl:Thing, we have <i>WebElement</i>. 
                                    This web element has 2 direct children: <i>CompositionalElements</i> and <i>StructuralElements</i>. The compositional elements are of two types :
                                    TextBasedElement and NonTextBasedElements. All these refers to components that can not contain any other components. Examples of these components are :
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Button</li>
                                        <li>Image</li>
                                        <li>Input</li>
                                        <li>Paragraph</li>
                                        <li>Title</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    The structural elements are elements that "structure" other elements. The structural elements are :
                                    <ol>    
                                        <li>List</li>
                                        <li>ListItem</li>
                                        <li>Accordion</li>
                                        <li>Banner</li>
                                        <li>Header</li>
                                        <li>Footer</li>
                                        <li>PhotoGallery</li>
                                    </ol>

                                The structure can be better seen here :
